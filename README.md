A Java Spring MVC project to manage student data on the basis of their Id's.
I have used MySql as a database and tomcate as a server.
Whole project follow a pattern called MVC(model view controller).
Model for dataFields,View for the front-end and controller to communicate between module and view.
It is a spring project so i used maven tool for auto configuration.
